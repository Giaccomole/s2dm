# Interactive GraphQL Schema Visualization

Explore the multiple classification schemes domain model through an interactive [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/graphql-kit/graphql-voyager) visualization. This schema demonstrates how **S2DM** enables flexible taxonomy management using SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System).

## SKOS Classification Structure

The classification scheme demonstrates:
- Concept hierarchies and relationships
- Cross-scheme mappings
- Multilingual label support
- Flexible taxonomy organization
