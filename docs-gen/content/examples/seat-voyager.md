# Interactive GraphQL Schema Visualization

Explore the seat capabilities domain model through an interactive [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/graphql-kit/graphql-voyager) visualization. This comprehensive schema, derived from the [Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/) `Seat` branch, demonstrates how **S2DM** effectively models complex automotive domain relationships including nested components (backrest, headrest, seating), enumerated values, and rich type relationships.
