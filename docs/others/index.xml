      <description>Background Why do we need such an approach? Subject Matter Experts are often NOT data modeling experts Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) are often not familiar with data modeling, nor are they following best practices to formalize their knowledge. This lack in expertise can be problematic when they are in charge of expanding and maintaining a certain controlled vocabulary that will be used in real systems at the enterprise level.&#xA;Vehicle Signal Specification has been an alternative but requires improvements When it comes to vehicle data, the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) has been offering an easy-to-follow approach to enable SMEs contribute to a controlled vocabulary of high-level vehicle properties (e.</description>

      <description>Basic principle The idea is that multiple systems in the physical layer (e.g., databases, streaming platforms, applications, etc.) can share the same concepts. However, instead of arbitrarily modeling domains in the physical layer, the purpose is to have a unique way for specifying the concepts of common interest and its organizing principles in such a way that they are reused. This principle is a core part of a data-centric architecture, reducing undesired duplications and software waste when it is systematically applied.</description>
